Hello! Im Jaden! Like I said last Tuesday, I have very minimal coding experience and was honestly really nervous when I found out how in depth the 
coding we were doing in this class was gonna be, but after Thursdays little test run Im actually really excited to be doing like, real real coding. 
I have a feeling I'm gonna have a lot of frustrating moments but hey, thats just codiing isnt it. And I'm excited for the moments where I finally 
figure it out. I was also very greatful for the sharing of Dorothy Santos's Reading of "Picked Last". I felt seen and less nervous at being so new to 
coding. 

Goals for the Quarter: Have a broader understanding of code, be able to utilize at least 3 different coding websites, not pull an all nighter, 
reduce frustration as much as possible with coding, and HAVE FUN!

Copy and Paste of Coding Play we did on Thursday:

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background("papayaWhip");
  strokeWeight (4)
  stroke("pink")
  fill ("#AEA2DE")
  circle (200,200,50)
  circle (50,50,20)
  stroke ("purple")
  strokeWeight (4)
  strokeWeight ("green")
}
