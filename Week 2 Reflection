Week 2 Reflection:

This week was fun and very interesting. Going over the readings I really enjoyed "When things go wrong", because I very much felt reassured that coding is collaborative and difficult, and
that making mistakes is totally okay, even professors do it. I also liked "Making P5.js" and It reminded me of similar concepts I'm learning in my Visual Culture classes with accessibility
and who these programs are made for, how language, culture. accessibility all impact the source. When it comes to the weekly videos I was pleasantly surprised. Usually I struggle with videos 
like that, especially that long, but the coding train has very helpful explinations and I was not only able to follow along, but notes were taken as well! All around I know with my minimal
codinh experience I might be a little farther behind in class shares than others with more experience, but I dont feel bad or left behind. I plan on spending some more time outside of class 
to mess around and practice with P5.js. I really wanna get the torus to work. A lot of the coding is making sense, and I know how to do it, I'll just need more practice because I want to be
able to do a lot of this stuff without a refrence. Anyways, this weeks coding with the pictures and text was super interesting! Heres the link to that project where I kinda tried to make a 
layered photo: https://editor.p5js.org/baylif/sketches/23d8q-Ova

Again, I'm really excited to see how in depth I can go with coding!
