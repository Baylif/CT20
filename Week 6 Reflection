Week 6 Reflection

Week 6! I genuinley thought it was still week 5, ive been quite the busy bee both with other schoolwork and some outside activities. Last week I was really lost when it comes to HTML.
The first 5 minuites made sense and I was pretty locked in, and then at a certain point i got really really lost. I think it was right after we learned how to attatch videos and then we 
started to dig into the more advanced stuff. The rest of that day i tried my absolute best to follow along, and the thursday class. I managed to get the basics and then a few extra add ons
but i was really nervous to continue on, so when Prof said we were gonna spend this week continuing with HTML I was really happy. I will be honest, im still a little lost on just the general
idea which im sad about because I feel like I got coding in P5JS much easier. but at the end of the day Ive got the basic grasp, and if Im really in need of help the Yuja videos are there to 
help which im so glad were utilizing. Outside of that I havent gotten the oprotunity to update and fix my card clock which im pretty sad about as I really do want to have finished and updated,
but once World of Dance Competiton is over I will def have more time to work on it! Im excited to see what we end up doing in json, and I hope I get a lot of inspiration on what to do for either
the second project, or a basic HTML website. Im really excited to see what i make with the bext project I really wanna indluge in interest which will make the project easier. Overall,
I still feel pretty good in this class! Its fun, confusing, but I dont really feel left behind, just like,, We all know a little but of something different which is actually pretty cool.
