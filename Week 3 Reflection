Week 3 Reflection:

Week 4 around the corner already! Wow! My goodness it feels like its all going by so fast. This week was really enjoyable, working with the Mass MoCA wall arts. I really wanted to ensure I
knew the basics so I chose wall art 391 because it focused on lines and colors. I figured once I got it done I could mess with the time function and maybe see if I could change up some colors.
Heres the code for that!:
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(400);

//grid
line(200,0, 200, 400);
  stroke("black");
  strokeWeight(25);
  
line(0,200, 400, 200);
  stroke("black");
  strokeWeight(25);
  
line(5,2,5,400);
   stroke("black");
  strokeWeight(25);
  
line(2,5, 400, 5);
line(395, 5, 395, 395);
line(0,395, 395, 395);
  strokeWeight(25);
//grid end
  
  line(0,400,200,200);
  strokeWeight(25);
  line(0,325,125,200);
  line(0,260,60,200);
  line (80,400,200,280);
  line(140,400,200,340)
}

I didnt end up finishing it which I really should have and definetley want too. I fear though that Im still pretty fresh at coding that its taking a long time. I am definetley 
understanding more and more how in depth coding can get, and also that im really in desperate need of some practice. I dont want to jump to fear because I feel theres no need for that yet,
but over this next week I really want to spend more time coding. I want to get the torus to work, and Id really like to try and get some sort of working clock, even if its crazy simple.
Im excited to see what this week brings and I know that the clock is coming up soon, so better get started on practice pretty soon! Maybe if I get lost the coding train can help or
I can jump to the Element chats. What I AM afraid of mostly, is that Ill be limited by simplicity in my projects because I dont know how to do things. I want to make a cool clock
and dont want the fact I dont know how to do some code stop me from making what Im wanting to make. So, off to practice some coding!
